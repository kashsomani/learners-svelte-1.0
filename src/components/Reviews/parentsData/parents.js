            appreciated while exposing them to unique facilities like 3D printing, 
            swimming and guitar classes. Hardworking and dedicated teachers are the essence
            of LA. There is always a joy when we, students and parents, enter the school. 
            We always feel a sense of belonging and know that this school looks out for our
            kids and ensures that they get the best in every aspect. I am ever so grateful
            to the administration, teachers and non-teaching staff for delivering the
            highest standards in education for our students. Learners' Academy will

            nearly twenty years, with both my children having studied there. 
            They have been very lucky to get amazing mentors in the form of teachers,
            admins, coordinators and non teaching staff as well.  Learners' has the
            perfect blend of studies and extra curricular activities, always ready
            to adapt to the changing times. 
            Specially in these challenging times, Learners' was one of the first
            schools to quickly start online classes, so that students don't suffer. 
            For that we'll always be grateful. 
            When a seed grows to be a tree, it never ends it's ties with the roots,
            because that's where it's support and strength lies. Similarly, though 
            our children have finished schooling, they will always remain  connected
            with the school and proud to be associated with it
