            of LA. There is always a joy when we, students and parents, enter the school. 
            We always feel a sense of belonging and know that this school looks out for our
            kids and ensures that they get the best in every aspect. I am ever so grateful

            They have been very lucky to get amazing mentors in the form of teachers,

            Learners' family. Both my children - completed their entire school life in
            this school, right from Lower KG up until STD X. Learners' Academy has played a 
            huge role in their childhood, and has been a second home to them. The teachers
            and faculty take utmost care of each child, as if they were their own.
            What is great about this school is that you can approach them and request to
            see a teacher to check you child's progress without haveing to wait fot the open day
            held twice a year.
            Apart from imparting teaching the school also focusses on discipline, hygiene,
            good manners, etc. which is essential for every child's formative years. The teachers
            are caring and recognize each child's uniqueness. Being a small school each child is
            given individual attention, and teachers have a personal touch with all students. Every
            child has the oppotunity to shine on Annual Day with a role comfortable for them to undertake
            factoring in the child's choice / interest. Students havea stress free environment here in Learners'
            and are comfortable to voice their opinions.
            The teachers are amazing and the child doesn't hesitate to approach their teacher in times of doubt
            or to clear any queries any time. The school always finds ways to make education fun for students.
            Meghan will never forget how she mastered the numbers in French, by learning to sing the numbers
            in French, mmaking it easy to remember as well as improve her pronounciation. Learners' encourages
            the students to form a more healthy and friendly environment. Having experienced college life, Abriel
            has renewed appreciation for the care, encouragement and guidance he received at Learners'
            The teachers were like second parents to my children and made them feel proud and accomplished in
            whatever activity they did. The support staff have been equally wonderful with the children, hand holding
            them when they were babies to correcting them during their notorious times. These memories will remain
            with both my children forever.
            Many activities and facilities have improved throughout the years to create the best place for our children's
            development. A child's development is formed by enviornment and experience witth friends, family and teachers.
