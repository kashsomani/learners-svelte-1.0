	Learnersâ€™ Academy was established in June 1983 with only Pre-Primary
	and Primary sections. Today, we have classes up to Std. X
	(I.C.S.E.). We have grown with our children to give our community a
	home where learning begins and from where emerge the citizens of
	tomorrow. We have cutting-edge technologies coupled with experienced
	teachers to cater to the intrinsic as well as extrinsic devlopments
	of all children. With STEM being our primary focus, our alumni have
	consistently gone forward to work in various industries such as
	medicine, engineering, technology and many more.
